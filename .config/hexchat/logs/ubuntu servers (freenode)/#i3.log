May 30 10:32:24 <dayFun>	Hey All- I'm trying to debug an issue after i3 initially starts: everything seems to work okay, except my cursor shows a loading/spinning icon for 20 or so seconds after it boots.  
May 30 10:32:24 <dayFun>	I've double checked my config file and there doesn't seem to be an issue.  When I check the logs, the main thing that jumps out at me: "handlers.c:handle_motion_notify:207 - MotionNotify for an unknown container, checking if it crosses screen boundaries."

May 30 10:46:59 <dayFun>	@f8l, yeah, I was commenting lines out to try and find my problem, right now I only have 2 uncommented: "exec_always /home/dayfun/.screenlayout/1x2x1.sh exec --no-startup-id nm-applet"
May 30 10:48:49 <f8l>	You probably need a --no-startup-id option for that script as well.
May 30 10:49:36 <f8l>	The rule is, more or less, that everything that has no GUI should be executed with that option.

May 30 10:52:07 *	MarkusDBX has quit (Ping timeout: 246 seconds)
May 30 10:52:28 <dayFun>	so that took care of my cursor showing the loading dialog, but my i3-debug-log is still peppered with "05/30/2017 10:50:07 AM - handlers.c:handle_motion_notify:207 - MotionNotify for an unknown container, checking if it crosses screen boundaries."
May 30 10:53:29 <f8l>	I can’t help with this one without diving into the code. Sorry.

May 30 10:55:56 <f8l>	I don’t have any of these in my log, but I have a single screen, so I probably shouldn’t. I wouldn’t worry about the message much. It’s a debug log after all.
May 30 10:56:25 <dayFun>	Yeah, I don't think it's causing any issues, just trying to understand everything...

May 30 15:37:03 <freem_>	well, to be clear, I think netbsd is a whole distrib, while linux is only a kernel, and that gnu/linux target something that can be usable by anyone even if it means the code is not clean, unlike netbsd

May 30 22:25:51 <cliff>	let me install something like gimp and try with that.
May 30 22:27:24 <occultus>	i just tried a bunch of stuff and it's hit or miss
May 30 22:28:44 <occultus>	gimp - slow, started-on. chromium - slow, switched-to. file manager - slow-ish, started-on. texstudio - splash on started on, then reappears on switched-to
May 30 22:30:07 <cliff>	ah.  got it to happen with simcity under wine(duh).
May 30 22:31:12 <cliff>	And yeah...can't kill that now...and fans all just ramped up.
May 30 22:31:20 <occultus>	hehe
May 30 22:32:58 <cliff>	My ignorant solution is to assign that wm class or instance to a specific workspce.
May 30 22:35:37 <cliff>	But yeah... 'Called in ws[FOO], therefore open in ws[FOO] would be nice...though I imagine there is more to it when using a multi-headed system.
May 30 22:40:13 <occultus>	cliff: i3 is supposed to try, i'd guess it's the individual app not respecting it properly
May 30 22:48:18 <cliff>	Yeah.  It definitely tries.  It's really difficult to beat it to a new workspace...even with friggin simcity4

May 31 01:27:16 <Celmor>	hi
May 31 01:27:21 <Eyo>	hello!
May 31 01:27:32 <thebardian>	Can someone tell me, I have a function set to a bindsym it works great...
May 31 01:27:43 <thebardian>	I want to execute it also from a script with i3-msg
May 31 01:27:47 <thebardian>	How do I?
May 31 01:28:34 <thebardian>	mode "$mode_system" { ...
May 31 01:28:56 <thebardian>	So I want to execute it from terminal, I try i3-msg mode_system
May 31 01:29:13 <Celmor>	try sending the part after 'bindsym <key kombination>' via i3-msg to that socket
May 31 01:29:26 <thebardian>	bindsym $mod+Escape mode "$mode_system"
May 31 01:29:37 <thebardian>	so what do you recommend I try Celmor?
May 31 01:29:59 <Celmor>	try sending 'mode "$mode_system"'
May 31 01:30:00 <thebardian>	i3-msg mode "$mode_system"
May 31 01:30:20 <Celmor>	more lik as a single string
May 31 01:30:33 <Celmor>	wrap it in single quotes like I did
May 31 01:30:34 <thebardian>	[{"success":true}]
May 31 01:30:36 <thebardian>	outputs
May 31 01:30:38 <thebardian>	^
May 31 01:30:46 <Celmor>	but did it do what you expected?
May 31 01:30:47 <thebardian>	But does nothing?
May 31 01:30:54 <thebardian>	No :(
May 31 01:31:06 <Celmor>	did you wrap the whole string in single quotes?
May 31 01:31:06 <thebardian>	It's supposed to launch my shutdown/reboot/logout menu
May 31 01:31:19 <thebardian>	i3-msg 'mode "$mode_system"'
May 31 01:31:30 <Celmor>	then it probably doesn't recognize $mode_system
May 31 01:31:50 <thebardian>	The keybind works great!
May 31 01:32:04 <thebardian>	bindsym $mod+Escape mode "$mode_system"
May 31 01:32:10 <Celmor>	don't have that much experience with i3 'syntax' but I would try to execute the { ... part instead of referring to it via $mode_system
May 31 01:32:12 <thebardian>	just how to execute it from terminal im lost.
May 31 01:32:44 <thebardian>	Thanks for the idea.
May 31 01:33:47 <thebardian>	I don't think that will work.
May 31 01:34:08 <thebardian>	Maybe someone else will chime in. Thanks
May 31 01:34:58 <HcsOmot>	I just stumbled upon something that may be a bug, but aren't sure. i'm using i3-gaps, i3 version 4.12 (2016-03-06, branch "4.12"), Chromium 58.0.3029.110 Built on Ubuntu , running on Ubuntu 16.04.

May 31 02:02:39 <okraits>	Amnesia: Well, i3bar uses a json protocol which you can use to send input to it
May 31 02:02:55 <okraits>	Amnesia: which statusline generator do you use?
May 31 02:03:49 <Amnesia>	i3status

May 31 02:05:14 <Amnesia>	noice!, tyvm
May 31 02:05:42 <okraits>	Amnesia: I recommend the python wrapper: https://github.com/i3/i3status/blob/master/contrib/wrapper.py

May 31 02:12:32 <Amnesia>	okraits: is there also some way to do it with two instances of i3status?
May 31 02:12:42 <Amnesia>	(cause I've got one instance running, that reads ~/.i3status.conf)

May 31 02:18:05 <okraits>	You would like to add some output to the output of i3status, right?
May 31 02:20:15 <Amnesia>	correct
May 31 02:20:35 <okraits>	But why do you need a second i3status instance?
May 31 02:21:34 <Amnesia>	currently I've got "        status_command i3status -c ~/.i3/i3status.conf
May 31 02:21:41 <Amnesia>	 in my i3 config
May 31 02:21:50 <Amnesia>	and I'd like another script to append to that
May 31 02:22:01 <okraits>	you need:
May 31 02:22:18 <Amnesia>	 (instead of having to change the status_command value to a wrapper that adds something to i3status's output)
May 31 02:22:46 *	solenodic has quit (Quit: WeeChat 1.8)
May 31 02:22:47 <okraits>	status_command i3status -c ~/.i3/i3status.conf | /path/to/wrapper.py
May 31 02:23:51 <okraits>	you mean you want to append the additional output on one machine and not append it on another machine?
May 31 02:24:52 <Amnesia>	no, I was just wondering if there was a way to use a named pipe, which I can throw stuff into, to get it displayed:D
May 31 02:25:40 <okraits>	not for i3status I think, but you can add that functionality to wrapper.py
May 31 02:25:44 <Amnesia>	ack
May 31 02:26:22 <okraits>	that's the advantage of the json protocol, you can easily extend the output of i3status
May 31 02:27:26 <Amnesia>	check
May 31 02:34:36 <Amnesia>	okraits: implemented it myself, tyvm for your help <3

May 31 15:02:58 <MtotheM_>	Is there anyway to make links clickable in the default i3 terminal?
May 31 15:03:23 <ohaither>	callumstyan, nice. I've seen a lot of people into the x200 and t60, any specific reason behind?
May 31 15:04:16 <callumstyan>	no clue to be honest
May 31 15:04:27 <callumstyan>	I wanted something a bit smaller than the T line
May 31 15:04:41 <callumstyan>	and a coworker had an x260
May 31 15:05:05 <ohaither>	callumstyan, gotcha. I'm googling the specs
May 31 15:05:29 <nimaje>	MtotheM_: there is no default i3 terminal, only a script testing for diffrent terminals and executing the first found

May 31 15:06:25 <ohaither>	probably :P
May 31 15:06:30 <callumstyan>	but I think with any thinkpad + mainstream distro you'll be fine
May 31 15:06:44 <callumstyan>	if you wanted to setup debian or arch from scratch you might have a bit more work to do
May 31 15:07:09 <callumstyan>	I just got mine, updated the bios, and from there you can just install ubuntu and never think about it again if you wanted
May 31 15:07:15 <ohaither>	I went manjaro because of that, arch based without so much trouble
May 31 15:07:38 <ohaither>	in fact I'm using it now on my MB under VBox
May 31 15:08:03 <ohaither>	regular bios update? or you went some libreboot or something?
May 31 15:08:17 <ohaither>	I'm just getting into this, sorry if dumb questions
May 31 15:09:02 <callumstyan>	whatever the thinkpad instructions were for bios updates
May 31 15:09:13 <callumstyan>	you'll find better info about this in other irc channels though :)
May 31 15:09:33 <nimaje>	MtotheM_: some (most?) terminals support clickable links, but as that is terminal dependend you first need to find out what terminal you use
May 31 15:09:56 <ohaither>	fair enough, just felt like finding ppl to chat in general involving i3
May 31 15:10:07 <ohaither>	so... let's talk i3 :P
May 31 15:11:17 <ohaither>	any way to change the border of the active window? I know it's possible to change the gaps, but haven't found a solution for the color. I find it has a lack of contrast and it's a bit difficult for me to know in which window I'm at the moment
May 31 15:11:55 <ohaither>	I went through the manual but only saw the kind of border, nothing about the color
May 31 15:12:17 <ohaither>	so maybe there's a 3rd party package or something

May 31 15:14:33 <ohaither>	nimaje, I'll double check. The color I'm looking to change is not in the bars, but on the actual border of the terminals. The ones that appear with $mod+Return

May 31 15:17:44 <ohaither>	In fact, I was just double checking
May 31 15:18:18 <ohaither>	the thing is that I did try changing client focused and it didn't change the color after reloading the config and opening new windows
May 31 15:18:30 <ohaither>	I'll try restarting i3 instead
May 31 15:18:55 <nimaje>	llinguini: well, there or in another file in the x startup sequence (e.g. .xinitrc if you use startx/xinit)

May 31 15:20:45 <llinguini>	Also, for some reason, everything in i3 just appears bigger
May 31 15:21:02 <llinguini>	as in, it seems like the resolution is incorrect
May 31 15:21:20 <callumstyan>	yep! I had the same issue as you when I first started using i3
May 31 15:21:20 <llinguini>	but that's not the case as xrandr reports the correct resolution,
May 31 15:21:24 <callumstyan>	Note that for the window decorations, the color around the child window is the "child_border", and "border" color is only the two thin lines around the titlebar.
May 31 15:22:05 <llinguini>	and when I run gnome, with the same gtk theme, everything appears normal

May 31 16:37:02 <occultus>	anything vte (gnome/xfce/termite) has emoji scroll issues, urxvt makes you specify font fallbacks manually, and st has to be recompiled to change settings
May 31 16:38:36 <cliff>	Does any emulator support some kind of keyboard only text selection and yanking?
May 31 16:43:22 <Xenguy>	MtotheM_: I am sticking with 'roxterm' because I like it so much, even tho I found out it is going to be unmaintained, due to the bloody annoying issues associated with GTK3 : -/

May 31 16:57:59 <cliff>	There is more than one advantage to doing that of course....
May 31 16:59:13 <cliff>	tmux is new to me.  I got lost comparing the two and never moved on to trying to configure one or the other as a default operating environment.
May 31 17:00:39 <Xenguy>	A lot of folks seem to favor the new kid on the block, tmux, but screen has worked for me for years, so I just stick with it, as I know if well enough now
May 31 17:00:53 <Xenguy>	Either should work for your requirement though

May 31 18:39:32 <xlaech>	@MtotheM_ what bar do you use?
May 31 18:40:11 <MtotheM_>	xlaech, the default one
May 31 18:40:24 <thebardian>	i3bar
May 31 18:40:46 <cliff>	Mtothem, it depends on what media player you are using.  Then you need to discover how to pull out the 'now playing' information out via the terminal.  Once you have that you can craft a script to pull and format that information to your liking for the status bar.  I use clementine for local files and public radio streams, so if I wanted the now playing my info I would start with '$ qdbus org.mpris.clementine

Jun 01 04:25:41 <throstur>	how od I change the font that i3 uses? specifically the size and such? I tried changing xresources and xrdb it but it only changed terminal
Jun 01 04:26:34 <brainwash>	throstur: https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html#fonts
Jun 01 04:26:41 <throstur>	thanks
Jun 01 04:27:02 <brainwash>	:)
Jun 01 04:27:32 <throstur>	brainwash: doesn't seem to affect the status bar, which is what I was actually interested in (sorry)
Jun 01 04:28:02 <throstur>	but i found that in there too, thanks!
Jun 01 04:28:49 <brainwash>	ah cool
Jun 01 04:30:07 <ohaither>	anybody in here successfully using gestures on a trackpad? I'm specifically interested in 2 fingers rotation and tiptap. I'm checking libinput-gestures but probably won't be able to use it under VBox?
Jun 01 04:31:03 *	nona has quit (Remote host closed the connection)
Jun 01 04:31:04 <ohaither>	also, any recommended way to re-map keys? something like Alt+Ctrl = Delete
Jun 01 04:32:29 <throstur>	ohaither: you should change your keymappings with an xorg.conf.d config file
Jun 01 04:32:59 <throstur>	ohaither: hopefully there is an option that does what you want already, eg. I use Option "XKbOptions" "caps:escape,altwin:swap_lalt_lwin"
Jun 01 04:33:20 <ohaither>	throstur: I'll look into it, thanks!
Jun 01 04:33:51 <ohaither>	throstur, by any chance do you know if it's possible to map the Fn key ?
Jun 01 04:33:54 <throstur>	ohaither: I don't know if alt+ctrl -> delete is something that many people would use though so don't know about that
Jun 01 04:34:17 <throstur>	ohaither: the Fn key (as far as my knowledge goes) only works at a hardware level, i.e. it acts as a switch for other keys at the hardware level, and as such produces no keycode
Jun 01 04:34:35 <throstur>	ohaither: you can check whether it does inded produce a keycode (highly unlikely) using a terminal tool that echoes all keystrokes
Jun 01 04:34:54 <throstur>	ohaither: but what you *can* do, is remap fn and ctrl in BIOS
Jun 01 04:35:22 <ohaither>	throstur, sure, it was just an example. I'm actually trying to achieve Cmd+Fn = Foward Delete. I do it with Karabiner under OSX 10.11 and I have a quite strong muscle memory on it... would prefer not having to give up on it
Jun 01 04:35:54 <throstur>	do you use the same hardware? if it works on $placeholder it works on linux
Jun 01 04:36:26 <ohaither>	yes, same hardware, but actually running manjaro-i3 under VBox, if it makes any difference
Jun 01 04:38:31 <ohaither>	throstur, I might be confused, but I think manjaro-i3 doesn't use xorg but Wayland. Does it make any difference?
Jun 01 04:39:26 *	nona (~nona@catv-89-132-115-162.catv.broadband.hu) has joined
Jun 01 04:39:33 <throstur>	ohaither: I know about neither tbh
Jun 01 04:39:47 <ohaither>	np, thanks anyways :)
Jun 01 04:39:56 <throstur>	ohaither: basically you need to figure out what your keyboard is doing on a hardware level to change the behavior on the software level
Jun 01 04:40:09 <throstur>	once you know this it's just a matter of connecting the dots so to speak
Jun 01 04:41:24 <ohaither>	sure thing, I've been digging into this since Monday. Totally looking forward to ditch the MB and move to i3 fulltime on a ThinkPad
Jun 01 04:41:54 <throstur>	I can really recommend that setup
Jun 01 04:42:12 <throstur>	the pointing stick (red dot mouse) REALLY synergizes with 99% keyboard use
Jun 01 04:42:21 <throstur>	and i3 supports that soooo well
Jun 01 04:42:37 <ohaither>	I know! I had 2 or 3 thinkpads in the past, I love the 'clit' :P
Jun 01 04:43:44 <throstur>	hehe... we call it that too
Jun 01 04:43:59 <throstur>	most underrated piece of hardware in computing today
Jun 01 04:44:23 <ohaither>	what I do like about the MB's trackpad, and honestly was one of the main reasons why I switched few years ago, is the gestures I configured with BetterTouchTool and how smooth it behaves
Jun 01 04:44:49 <ohaither>	exactly, ppl don't know what they're missing

Jun 01 11:38:35 <qball>	yeah known
Jun 01 11:38:52 <qball>	not sure if there is a solution, it is annoying enough

Jun 01 11:44:06 <chainsaw10>	Thanks for the bug link. Kinda frustrating there's no easy fix; I was hoping someone found a workaround.
Jun 01 11:44:27 <chainsaw10>	I'll fiddle with hardware acceleration for a few min, just in case that works
Jun 01 11:44:31 <chainsaw10>	I do have the guest additions
Jun 01 11:44:33 <netvor>	hi guys, can i enable/disable a particular bar?  my custom bar is called 'clementine' and "bar mode clementine invisible" throws syntax error
Jun 01 11:45:50 <netvor>	oh I got it
Jun 01 11:46:10 <netvor>	it's "i3-msg bar mode invisible clementine" :)
Jun 01 11:46:46 <chainsaw10>	ScottE, disabling 2d video acceleration seems to help. If I double tap Mod+F real quick, I'm able to trick it into working somewhat decently. Thanks for the suggestion!
Jun 01 11:48:44 <ScottE>	OK, good chainsaw10! Glad it helped, it was a random guess but I vaguely remember seeing something like it before

Jun 01 14:36:12 <Eyo>	hello!
Jun 01 14:36:41 <ZyX-I>	Language rules.  Though I just realized, I should write more space after sentence ends and I almost never do this.
Jun 01 14:36:53 *	ohaither has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
Jun 01 14:36:57 <qball>	What english language rules?
Jun 01 14:37:05 <squigz>	1 space is fine.
Jun 01 14:38:35 <callumstyan>	pretty sure the 2 spaces after a period thing is dead
Jun 01 14:39:10 <freem_>	ZyX-I: I guess someone should invent and IRC client that translate LaTeX into irc in real time
Jun 01 14:40:07 *	venmx has quit (Ping timeout: 260 seconds)
Jun 01 14:40:11 <freem_>	on the other hand, wouldn't it be a pain to write latex stuff for instant messages?
Jun 01 14:40:30 <ZyX-I>	callumstyan: Vim help still uses that.  Have not seen it in other places.  Not sure about LaTeX, but this system is supposed to do proper spacing automatically.
Jun 01 14:41:00 <callumstyan>	ah you mean language parsing rules
Jun 01 14:41:30 <callumstyan>	I thought we were talking about like, actually writing English sentences for papers or some shit
Jun 01 14:41:43 <freem_>	Proper typography, I think. Depending on headers. I've no clue about the proper typo' in my native language, so in english, it's obviously worse
Jun 01 14:41:56 <ZyX-I>	callumstyan: These are typography rules.  Though I know Russian ones better.  Typography applies to every place where text is displayed, not only paper.

Jun 01 14:42:38 <callumstyan>	I was called out in university for writing papers and using 2 spaces after a period
Jun 01 14:42:44 <callumstyan>	1 space is the standard now apparently
Jun 01 14:42:45 <freem_>	really?
Jun 01 14:43:03 <freem_>	I mean, 2 spaces was the english norm?
Jun 01 14:43:22 <freem_>	maybe it's about the length of the spaces?
Jun 01 14:44:04 <callumstyan>	yeah, I was taught 2 spaces in highschool
Jun 01 14:44:15 <callumstyan>	and then it was 1 in university
Jun 01 14:44:54 <ZyX-I>	freem_: It should be a “length of the space between sentences”, but as in most places you write text you can’t actually define this value you have to emulate.
Jun 01 14:45:21 <qball>	hmm
Jun 01 14:45:33 <freem_>	Oh. I've read here or there that there are unicode characters that are actually just spaces with different size?
Jun 01 14:45:44 *	PatrolDoom has quit (Ping timeout: 255 seconds)
Jun 01 14:46:16 <freem_>	or unbreakable spaces? (sorry for bad orthograph, please correct me if possible)
Jun 01 14:46:51 <ZyX-I>	callumstyan: You are unlucky.  When I was asking my supervisor of studies about following Russian national standards he advised to scratch that.
Jun 01 14:47:51 <ZyX-I>	freem_: Unicode has many weird spaces.  I used U+FEFF ZERO-WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE to bypass some chat’s anti-harrassment system.
Jun 01 14:48:07 <freem_>	huhu
Jun 01 14:48:19 <freem_>	nice trick
Jun 01 14:48:52 <ZyX-I>	freem_: Basically there are spaces of different length, unbreakable spaces, zero-width spaces (AFAIR there is also a breakable zero-width one).
Jun 01 14:49:27 <freem_>	I wonder what might be the purpose of 0-width space?
Jun 01 14:49:33 <freem_>	wasting ram?
Jun 01 14:50:54 <ZyX-I>	freem_: Bypass anti-harassment system?  The chat I was talking about has (had? Not playing that anymore) some problems even with numbers 89 and 64.
Jun 01 14:51:45 <freem_>	I doubt unicode guys had that kind of things in mind... if they had, then, I might start questionning that standard someday

Jun 01 14:52:56 <freem_>	powerline symbols?
Jun 01 14:53:18 <ZyX-I>	U+1F4A9 PILE OF POO emoji.
Jun 01 14:53:50 <qball>	💩
Jun 01 14:53:58 <freem_>	ah. Emojis. Well. Yes. That's pretty stupid for sure, especially since emojis where first combinations of caracters
Jun 01 14:54:09 <freem_>	-.-
Jun 01 14:54:31 <qball>	💩
Jun 01 14:54:33 <qball>	hmm
Jun 01 14:54:44 <freem_>	ok, I'll probably start to question the standard sooner or later.
Jun 01 14:54:58 <freem_>	still, what could be powerline symbols?
Jun 01 14:54:58 <ZyX-I>	freem_: Powerline symbols are that: https://github.com/powerline/powerline, see screenshots (arrows and > there).  BTW, have i3 bar support there, though it appeared to start working only after I switched to i3 myself.
Jun 01 14:55:46 <freem_>	ah. Yes. Much more useful than crappy emoticrap
Jun 01 14:55:49 <ZyX-I>	freem_: These are in private use area, so unless you have powerline fonts (some fonts like terminus have adopted the glyphs into upstream) it is pointless.
Jun 01 14:56:07 <ZyX-I>	* I mean, pointless to post these symbols here.
Jun 01 14:56:16 <freem_>	understood
Jun 01 14:56:40 <qball>	🍵
Jun 01 14:57:08 <nimaje>	well, zero-width space is for "that is normally together, but if you need to break it, break it here" (not sure for what the ZERO-WIDTH NO-BREAK SPACE is)

Jun 01 14:57:49 <freem_>	oh, it's an advice for the soft... still seems useless to me

Jun 01 15:00:15 <ZyX-I>	freem_: To get a perfect view of LaTeX files you sometimes need to give such hints.  Except that LaTeX has its own means for stating “this should not be broken” and “this may be broken here” and I did not see other places where somebody will bother.

Jun 01 20:35:38 <boomboxnation>	Is there a way to change the orientation of the status bar on one output in a multi headed environment?  I'd like my workspace 'tabs' in the upper right of the monitor to the left of my laptop.  I frequently don't notice urgency on my left hand monitor cause it's way outside my active field of view.
Jun 01 20:36:57 *	tasse has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Jun 01 20:37:55 <Ipsilon>	I don't believe this is possible (if I am understanding correctly) using i3bar
Jun 01 20:38:03 <Ipsilon>	but other bars may allow it
Jun 01 20:39:03 *	tasse (~tasse@x4db375f8.dyn.telefonica.de) has joined
Jun 01 20:39:35 <Ipsilon>	don't quote me here, but I think yabar allows you to put its "widgets' in any order
Jun 01 20:40:21 <callumstyan>	workspace indicator location isn't configurable in i3bar
Jun 01 20:40:28 *	hardbot has quit (Ping timeout: 240 seconds)
Jun 01 20:41:26 <boomboxnation>	Yeah...I basically want them closer to the upper left of my 'working' screen.  Maybe I can find a way to just turn something red on the bar on my main monitor if there is an urgency anywhere at all.  That's doable.
Jun 01 20:42:22 <callumstyan>	you could just hack i3bar in your own branch
Jun 01 20:42:30 <Ipsilon>	or you can dael that on a per-app basis
Jun 01 20:42:34 <Ipsilon>	*deal with
Jun 01 20:42:39 <callumstyan>	or add a feature request
Jun 01 20:42:44 <Ipsilon>	make the app send a notification
Jun 01 20:42:45 <callumstyan>	or search for an existing feature request
Jun 01 20:43:11 <Ipsilon>	ultimately I don't think your solution is the ideal one from a UX standpoint
Jun 01 20:43:36 <boomboxnation>	I'll just switch back to 4:3 monitors.  😋
Jun 01 20:43:56 <Ipsilon>	I don't u....forget it
Jun 01 20:44:18 <boomboxnation>	Heh.

Jun 02 05:43:55 <anchnk>	hi, I am using i3 as a window manager and I would like to know what would be the cleanest way to use dunst instead of notify-osd as dbus'notification client ?
Jun 02 05:44:03 <anchnk>	is it to kill the notify-osd daemon and then launch dunst process or can i replace notify-osd ?
Jun 02 05:46:34 <brainwash>	why is notify-osd running in the first place?
Jun 02 05:46:48 <anchnk>	I think it's by default in ubuntu
Jun 02 05:47:05 <brainwash>	can't you simply remove it?
Jun 02 05:47:10 <brainwash>	the package
Jun 02 05:47:57 <anchnk>	yeah I could do that but I thought I could switch between the two when I would like to
Jun 02 05:51:41 <okraits>	I also searched at one point but I don't know if you can define the notification daemon to be used at some place
Jun 02 05:51:57 <okraits>	I would also suggest to uninstall the daemon you don't want
Jun 02 05:52:25 <brainwash>	you could move /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service somewhere else
Jun 02 05:52:47 <brainwash>	this way notify-osd won't be activated via dbus anymore
Jun 02 05:53:13 <brainwash>	move this file back to restore notify-osd functionality
Jun 02 05:54:10 <anchnk>	awesome that will do it
Jun 02 05:54:40 <okraits>	the only issue here might be package updates :)

Jun 02 09:15:55 <vrederv>	Does i3 properly trigger the resize event for windows? Cause when I resize urxvt its content gets messed up even though urxvt does reflow-on-resize.
Jun 02 09:16:51 <vrederv>	It doesn't happen in floating mode (while it gets also messed up there it gets messed up in another way).
Jun 02 09:21:00 <vrederv>	Interestingly it doesn't happen with termite ...
Jun 02 09:21:38 <vrederv>	I am wondering if urxvt just doesn't understand a resize signal or if VTE is polling the window size.

Jun 02 13:38:53 <Absolute0>	size hints...
Jun 02 13:39:06 <callumstyan>	Improvotter, sounds like you want a terminal that supports tabs rather than i3 window tabs
Jun 02 13:39:24 <xyzzy[m]>	Can you try changing the font? Reducing the size, using the non-bold variant or trying another monospace font might help.
Jun 02 13:39:41 <Improvotter>	callumstyan: nah, why would I need that if i3 does it for me? Even more stuff to learn and that sounds redundant.

Jun 02 13:40:03 <nimaje>	Absolute0: probably that space is not big enought for another row, so urxvt has background color there, can also happen on the right
Jun 02 13:40:40 <callumstyan>	that's just how I interpreted your question
Jun 02 13:41:05 <callumstyan>	1 window can not be tabbed, multiple windows can be in a tabbed layout
Jun 02 13:41:32 <callumstyan>	unless you're using something like a terminal that supports tabs
Jun 02 13:41:41 <callumstyan>	but it seems someone else provided a solution :)
Jun 02 13:42:02 <Absolute0>	nimaje: in awesomewm I was able to fix the issue with some code in the config
Jun 02 13:42:22 <Absolute0>	oh I think it's the title bar
Jun 02 13:42:28 <Absolute0>	uses up the line

Jun 02 13:44:01 <LordCeprius>	Hey guys, when I press twice mod+enter and it will open 2 terminals
Jun 02 13:44:18 <LordCeprius>	but my cursor becomes loading and not finished till long time
Jun 02 13:44:36 <LordCeprius>	so I need to refresh the config to reset that problem. how can I fixed this?
Jun 02 13:46:09 <LordCeprius>	I read in reddit I have to replace loading cursor with normal cursor. But I don't want it
Jun 02 13:46:32 <xyzzy[m]>	You could add --no-startup-id to the line where the keybinding for the terminal is defined. This is just a workaround though. I don't know why it doesn't recognize that the application has been started.

Jun 02 14:34:28 <xyzzy[m]>	Try 'killall conky'. If that works all you need to do is remove conky from your autostart.
