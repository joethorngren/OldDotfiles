T 1496403835 18<27anchnk18>	hi, I am using i3 as a window manager and I would like to know what would be the cleanest way to use dunst instead of notify-osd as dbus'notification client ?
T 1496403843 18<27anchnk18>	is it to kill the notify-osd daemon and then launch dunst process or can i replace notify-osd ?
T 1496403994 18<26brainwash18>	why is notify-osd running in the first place?
T 1496404008 18<27anchnk18>	I think it's by default in ubuntu
T 1496404025 18<26brainwash18>	can't you simply remove it?
T 1496404030 18<26brainwash18>	the package
T 1496404077 18<27anchnk18>	yeah I could do that but I thought I could switch between the two when I would like to
T 1496404301 18<19okraits18>	I also searched at one point but I don't know if you can define the notification daemon to be used at some place
T 1496404317 18<19okraits18>	I would also suggest to uninstall the daemon you don't want
T 1496404345 18<26brainwash18>	you could move /usr/share/dbus-1/services/org.freedesktop.Notifications.service somewhere else
T 1496404367 18<26brainwash18>	this way notify-osd won't be activated via dbus anymore
T 1496404393 18<26brainwash18>	move this file back to restore notify-osd functionality
T 1496404450 18<27anchnk18>	awesome that will do it
T 1496404480 18<19okraits18>	the only issue here might be package updates :)
