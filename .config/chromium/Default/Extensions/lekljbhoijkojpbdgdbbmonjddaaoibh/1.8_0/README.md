# TubeLister

TubeLister collects all your open YouTube video tabs into one playlist tab to save memory and hassle!

The extension also extracts videos from existing Untitled playlists (that may have been generated before with the extension) and adds them to the list.

It also does not add duplicate videos and adds the focused Youtube video as first on the list.
